# ADR 003: Naming Convention

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Consistent resource naming is critical for:
- Resource identification and ownership
- Automation and scripting
- Cost allocation and billing
- Security and compliance auditing

## Decision

All resources follow the pattern: `${project}-${environment}-${service}-${resource}`

Examples:
- VPC: `tfgcp-prod-networking-vpc`
- Load Balancer: `tfgcp-staging-compute-lb`
- Cloud SQL: `tfgcp-dev-cloud-sql-instance`
- GCS: `tfgcp-prod-assets` (bucket names are globally unique)

## Rationale

- Immediately identifies project, environment, and purpose
- Supports label-based filtering and IAM policies
- Compatible with GCP resource name length limits
- Enables predictable resource discovery

## Consequences

- All modules must accept `project` and `environment` as inputs
- Naming validation enforced via variable validation blocks
- Long service names may need abbreviation
